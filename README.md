# Random Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple Random Number Guessing Game built in C++. The game generates a random number based on the selected difficulty, and the user has a limited number of attempts to guess it. Feedback is given after each guess to help the player.

## Program Objectives

- *Practice control structures*: Loops, conditionals, and input validation.
- *User interaction*: Allow users to select difficulty, input guesses, and receive feedback.
- *Random number generation*: Generate a random number within user-specified or predefined ranges.
- *Array usage*: Store and display user guesses for review at the end of the game.
- *Basic error handling*: Handle invalid inputs, such as non-integer guesses.

## Features

- Three difficulty levels:
  - *Easy*: User-defined range, 10 attempts.
  - *Medium*: Range 1-50, 6 attempts.
  - *Hard*: Range 1-20, 4 attempts.
- Random number generation within a specified range.
- User input validation to handle incorrect entries.
- Summary of the user's guesses at the end of the game.

## How to Play

1. Select a difficulty level.
2. Make guesses until you either guess the number or run out of attempts.
3. Receive feedback after each guess (Too high, Too low, or Correct).
4. The game will show a summary of your guesses after completion.
